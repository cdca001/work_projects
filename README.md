# Project Portfolio
Below are the projects I worked on for the past 6 years. I was the technical project manager for the majority of these projects where I was involved from the start upto tapeout. My day-to-day typically involves meeting various stakeholders e.g. clients, company ceo, physical design team, digital design team, and library characterization team and helping them remove road blocks and solve technical problems. 
In some of these, I was involved as technical resource mainly in charge of parasitic extraction, simulations and design review.
