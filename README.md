# Project Portfolio
Below are the projects I worked on for the past 6 years. I was the technical project manager for the majority of these projects where I was involved from the start upto tapeout. My day-to-day typically involves meeting various stakeholders e.g. clients, company ceo, physical design team, digital design team, and library characterization team and helping them remove road blocks and solve technical problems. 
In some of these, I was involved as technical resource mainly in charge of parasitic extraction, simulations and design review.

# MTC 3V, DTC 3V - 2020
Schedule: Jan 2020 - June 2020 (6 months)
The primary goal of the project was to create the physical implementation of two memory chips designed by our client. This was the first time that our company was asked to deliver two chips within a schedule of one. 
To meet the project deliverables and schedule, I added more people to the team which increased the budget for human resources and workstations. 
Since the two designs are completely independent of each other (i.e. no common components or dependent deliverables), I was able to manage the teams separately. I held daily stand ups for each team separately then we have all-hands meeting every other Friday afternoon so that the two teams can have a venue to share knowledge and methodologies.
To track project progress, I created separate Gantt charts and task trackers for each team. I updated the charts and trackers daily and every after team meetings. This ensured that teams gets the most updated information about the project which was crucial to keep everyone aligned.
Whenever I saw an opportunity to create slack in schedule, I made sure that we grab it. This was important because based from our experience, the client tends to do design changes towards the project deadline which leads to people working extended hours. By creating schedule slack, we ensured that towards the end of the project, we had the bandwidth to accommodate changes without negative impact on schedule. 
In the end, the team was able to meet the deadlines. We were able to provide the client with two memory chips within the schedule
