# Project Portfolio
Below are the projects I worked on for the past 6 years. I was the technical project manager for the majority of these projects where I was involved from the start upto tapeout. My day-to-day typically involves meeting various stakeholders e.g. clients, company ceo, physical design team, digital design team, and library characterization team and helping them remove road blocks and solve technical problems. 
In some of these, I was involved as technical resource mainly in charge of parasitic extraction, simulations and design review.

# MTC 3V, DTC 3V - 2020
Schedule: Jan 2020 - June 2020 (6 months)
The primary goal of the project was to create the physical implementation of two memory chips designed by our client. 
This was the first time that our company was tasked to deliver two chips with the schedule of one. To meet the project deliverables and schedule, I added more people to the team which increased the budget for human resources and workstations. 
Since the two designs are completely independent of each other (i.e. no common components or dependent deliverables), I was able to manage the teams separately. 
To track project progress, I created separate Gantt charts and task trackers for each team. 
I updated the charts and trackers daily
